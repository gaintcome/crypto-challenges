Several of the challenges are dynamic and require you to communicate using netcat or other tool for sending raw data over a socket.

For this challenge, connect on port 11111 to receive your flag. If you're having trouble connecting with netcat, feel free to skip to the General section and come back later.

Connect at nc socket.cryptohack.org 11111

``` 
go run sol.go
```
